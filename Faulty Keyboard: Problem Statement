The 'a' key on the keyboard is not working correctly. Instead of typing 'a' or 'A', it toggles the CapsLock. 
Return the value of a string that is typed into a keyboard on such a faulty keyboard.
Note: If shift is pressed when CapsLock is on characters will be printed in lower case

e.g. 
Input: "Help, my keyboard is not working"
Output: "Help, my keyboRD IS NOT WORKING"

Input: "Hi my name is Adam Levine"
Output: "Hi my nME IS dM lEVINE"
